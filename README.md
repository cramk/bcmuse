BC Download Web Interface + Backend



Vue based web UI for single tracks

Run backend via:

`node index.js` 

CORS header overwrite (browser plugin OR proxy) will be required to trigger the download.

Checkout http://equal-ticket.surge.sh/ for a demo (requires localhost + cors to actually use)


This is puppeteer based but a usable PoC.
